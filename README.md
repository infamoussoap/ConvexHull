# Convex optimization over a probability simplex
This repository contains the code for our paper [Convex optimization over a probability simplex](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09046). It has usable code for <ins>Projection onto a Convex Hull</ins>, <ins>Optimal Question Weighting</ins>, and reproducible code for these sections in the paper.

Our other [repository](https://github.com/infamoussoap/UniversalPortfolio) contains the code for <ins>Universal Portfolios</ins>.

## Implemented Algorithms
For both Projection onto a Convex Hull and Optimal Question Weighting, we implement Cauchy-Simplex, Pariwise Frank-Wolfe, and Exponentiated Gradient Descent.
